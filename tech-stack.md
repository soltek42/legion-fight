# 🌐 Technologies for Building Castle Fight as a Web Browser Game

Here’s a list of technologies you could use to develop an online version of **Castle Fight** that runs in a web browser.

---

## 1. Frontend (Client-Side)

### 🕹️ Game Engine
- **[PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/)** – 2D WebGL renderer with good performance and control.

### 🧱 UI Framework
- **React** – For building menus, lobbies, upgrades, etc.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI styling.

### 🎨 Assets
- **TexturePacker** or **Spine** – For sprite packing/animation (if needed).
- **SVG** – For dynamic unit/building icons.

---

## 2. Backend (Server-Side Logic & Sync)

### 🔧 Runtime Environment
- **Node.js** – Ideal for real-time game server logic.

### 🔄 Real-Time Communication
- **WebSockets (Socket.io)** – For fast bi-directional communication between server and clients.
- **Colyseus** – A multiplayer game server framework built on top of Node.js and WebSockets (highly recommended).

### 🧠 Game State Engine
- Custom game loop in Node.js using:
  - Fixed tick rate (e.g. 30–60 updates/sec)
  - Deterministic state updates (unit movement, spawns, combat)

---

## 3. Multiplayer Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL** – For persistent user data (e.g., stats, saves).
- **JWT / OAuth2** – For secure user authentication.

---

## 4. Deployment & Hosting

- **Vercel** or **Netlify** – For frontend hosting.
- **Render / Fly.io / Railway** – For hosting the game server.
- **Cloudflare** – For CDN, security, and low-latency edge delivery.

---

## 5. Dev & Tools

- **TypeScript** – For type safety and scalability across frontend and backend.
- **ESLint + Prettier** – Code quality tools.
